--------------------
Part 1. Introduction
--------------------
MidiMon is an application for monitoring incoming MIDI messages, as well as
sending test messages. This documentation will go over installation as well
as the various components and features.

MidiMon is generally designed to work with any MIDI module which implements the legacy 
Acorn MIDI module interface; however, it is only tested with the USB-MIDI module by Rick
Murray (v0.10 or higher), or with Peter Everett's USB-enabled MIDI Support System.
If you have any other MIDI modules or drivers, please feel free to reach out to me and let
me know how this works, keeping in mind the hardware support may vary by module.

MidiMon is free software, distributed under the terms of the Apache License,
version 2.0. See the included LICENSE file for more information.

See CHANGELOG for any differences from the previous version.

You should have received source with the distribution of MidiMon; MidiMon and its source
can be obtained from:

-------------------------------
 Part 2. Installing and Running 
-------------------------------
MidiMon is "installed" the same as any other RISC OS application; simply put
the app wherever you want. However, a couple other things to know on this
topic:

  - MidiMon saves its choices to a single data file in your Choices
    directory, typically at $.!Boot.Choices.MidiMon.
  - If a MIDI module is not already loaded on startup and MidiMon is unable
    to start one, a warning will be displayed and the application will exit.
  - MidiMon uses an additional helper module (MIDIEvent) to perform its 
    functions. This should not be stopped while MidiMon is running, or MidiMon
    will quit. MidiMon will unload this module on exit.
  - Hardware limitations and issues have limited the testability of this
    software somewhat; If any issues are encountered, I recommend confirming
    with your MIDI module's included test programs to ensure the module and
    hardware are working properly. You may need various combos of plugging,
    unplugging, rebooting, etc.
  - While I'm at it, here is the hardware involved: Raspberry Pi 400,
    Presonus AudioBox USB 96, generic USB to MIDI cable interface (the
    one with the treble staff logo; it's sold under a million made-up brands
    online). Additionally I've tried a Roland UM-ONE Mk2, and it doesn't work
    at all. My preferred interface is my Midiman MIDISPORT 2x2, but it
    requires special driver trickery, so it's unsurprisingly not supported. I
    used it hooked up to my Windows PC instead for testing.    
  - See the separate section entitled "Building" for information on
    building MidiMon from source.
    
-------------------------
Part 3. Features Overview
------------------------- 
Once MidiMon loads onto the Iconbar, clicking SELECT on its icon will
open the Monitor window. Clicking the MENU button on the icon opens the 
main menu. ADJUST clicking on the icon is currently unused.

Here are the main windows/functions comprising MidiMon, which are described
in their own sections below:

  - The Monitor window
  - The Piano window
  - The Messages window
  - The Song Control window
  - The Choices dialog
  - The Main menu

-------------------------
Part 4. The Icon Bar Menu 
-------------------------
The Icon Bar menu contains the following components:
  - Info: View information about the application.
  - Utilities: Opens a submenu which contains items which open the
    following windows: Piano, Messages, Song Control.
  - Reset MIDI: Resets the state of the MIDI module. This can sometimes 
    help if there is a problem.
  - Panic: Send a sweep of note off messages to attempt to force stuck
    notes off.
  - Help...: Opens this help file.
  - Choices...: Opens the Choices dialog.
  - Quit: Quits MidiMon.

--------------------------
Part 5. The Monitor Window
--------------------------  
The Monitor window shows incoming MIDI messages in a scrolling list.
Each message will be preceded by a port number and, when applicable, 
the channel number.
Clicking the MENU mouse button on the window opens a menu which
offers the following functions:
  - Save Log: Drag-and-drop save/copy of the full log to a text file.
  - Save Selection: Drag-and-drop save/copy of the currently selected log item.
  - Clear: Clear the log.

------------------------  
Part 6. The Piano Window  
------------------------
The Piano window contains a simple virtual piano/keyboard controller. Use
this to send test note messages. 

There is a two-octave keyboard of clickable buttons which are also
controllable by keys on the computer keyboard. Currently the key mapping is
static and unfortunately locked to a US/UK QWERTY layout. Key controls can be
used if the window has focus or if Hotkeys are enabled with the Hotkeys
option on the bottom toolbar, in which case the shortcuts can be used
regardless of what window has focus.  Behind the curtain, note that the key
focus model here uses a hack that goes outside the normal channels to handle
key releases properly, so it may behave in subtly different ways. Here is the
key mapping as it relates to the keys:

  2 3   5 6 7   S D   G H J
 Q W E R T Y U Z X C V B N M
                            
When first opened the window will not show all of the two octaves, but can be
resized or zoomed to show all keys.

The left toolbar contains a pitch bend control; Drag the bar up and down with
SELECT to bend the pitch, or click with ADJUST to reset the pitch to center.

On the bottom toolbar, there is also a slider to set the velocity of outgoing
notes as well as a control to shift the octave of the keys up and down by a
maximum of 5 octaves (C4, note 60, is considered Middle C). 
Note that the piano will only output valid MIDI notes, so in the very top and
bottom octaves some keys may not output notes.

---------------------------
Part 7. The Messages Window 
---------------------------
The Messages window allows you to send miscellaneous other types of MIDI
messages.

The Control Change section lets you send a Control Change message. Set the
controller number and value for the message and then click the associated
Send button. This does not currently list any of the standard controller
numbers, so please look up a guide online if needed.

The Program Change section lets you send a Program Change message for
changing patches/samples/sounds. The number box on the left lets you choose
by number and to the right is a list which will allow selection by standard
GM names. Select a program and click the associated Send button.
If the Bank Select option is selected, a Bank Select mesage will be sent
prior to Program Change using the specified MSB and LSB.

The Misc selection contains various other messages which can be sent which do
not need parameters; this currently includes Tune Request and System Reset
messages.

-------------------------------
Part 8. The Song Control Window 
-------------------------------
The Song Control window allows you to send various messages relating to song
playback contol. MidiMon does not currently handle anything relating to MTC,
MIDI Beat Clock, or any synchronization/clock features.

Use the Song Select number box to select a song number and then click the
associated Send button to send a Song Select message.

The Start, Continue, and Stop buttons send their respective MIDI song control
commands.

--------------------------
Part 9. The Choices Dialog  
-------------------------- 
The Choices dialog contains the following choices:
  - Tx Channel: Set the MIDI channel for outgoing MIDI messages.
  - Zero Velocity Note Off: When selected, send a Note On message with
    Velocity=0 instead of a Note Off message when ending a note.
  - Ignore Clock Messages: Ignore incoming clock messages.
  - Fake Fast Clock: Set module option to use system ticker instead of high
    resolution timer. See USB-MIDI's user guide for info on this option.
  - Use Hardware Delay: The USB-MIDI module uses this option to set a hardware
    delay for certain devices. See module documentation for more information.
  - Outbound in Monitor: Show outgoing messages in the monitor window.
    
Additionally, the buttons at the bottom have the standard meanings:
  - Default resets all choices to the default values.
  - Save saves the choices to the choices file in the system's Choices path.
  - Cancel closes the Choices dialog and discards any changes.
  - Set makes all choices active without saving to the choices file.

-------------------------------------
Part 10. Building MidiMon from Source 
-------------------------------------
MidiMon uses the User Interface Toolbox and is packaged to be built with the ROOL DDE.
The current release is built with: 
ROOL DDE 31c (cc 5.91/amu 5.36/link 5.39)

MidiMon uses the standard Makefiles; to build and install run the MkInstall
TaskObey script and to clean/remove, run the MkClean TaskObey script.

The subdirectory MIDIEvent contains the sources for the helper
module which delivers MIDI and key events to MidiMon. This has its own
build scripts which are run separately. When built, the binaries should be
placed into the Modules subdirectory as this is where MidiMon's Makefile will
pull from when installing.

------------------------------
Part 11. Issues and Miscellany  
------------------------------
  - Known issue: there will be a blank 'dummy' entry at the top of the monitor window
    at all times. This is to work around another issue, and can be safely ignored.
  - MidiMon outputs some messages to !Reporter:
    http://www.avisoft.f9.co.uk/Reporter.htm 
    A compile-time option can enable additional debug output through
    Reporter. !Reporter is not needed to use or run MidiMon.
